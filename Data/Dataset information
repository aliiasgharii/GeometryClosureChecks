In this project, a real cadastral dataset is used as our case study. This dataset includes 50 legal spaces representing both private ownership and common property.To testify the algorithms, different scenarios were designed to showcase how the geometry closure of 3D digital data associated with various complex legal spaces of a real multi-storey building can be checked through the primitive and advanced checks.
